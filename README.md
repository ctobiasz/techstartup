# Community-Chest

## Description
This group project is a full-scale web application that was created to learn Ruby on Rails.
The idea was to create a CRUD application to allow people to post items and give them away to the first poster.
Using Stripe API and a messaging system using ActionCable, we created a premium mode where users can view unlimited posts.


## Responsibilities
As a group we split the responsibilities evenly. I was tasked to create a secure authentication and authorization system. Using Devise gem would've been easier but I wanted to understand how it works from the ground up. As for the front-end responsibilities I was tasked with creating a navigation and categories page. Besides the actual programming, I was the go-to person to hear out new ideas and help debug problems.
