# Descripton
> This website was inspired by the BuyNothing Project. As a group we created a website that allows people to post their "junk" and allow users to message each other and call dibs on items for free.

# Responsibilities
> This project required me to work on the front and back-end.

> For the front-end: I made the navigation bar and the categories. The idea was to keep it simple and straight to the point.The categories page had the same mindset behind it. Keep it simple and allow users to quickly navigate to what they desire.

> For the back-end: I was instructed to work on the authenication and authorization. Although, Devise would make life much easier, I wanted to challenge myself and create the entire thing from scratch.
